Steps:
 + Pre-compute sin and cos
 + Clear depth buffer, clear wall buffer
 + Iterating over all the walls:
 - (Later: dot with the normal, discard facing outwards)
 + Apply transformations to each point
 + Find the depth and the row for each point
 + if depth is too far away or below 0, discard.
 + Iterate between the rows (inclusive)
 + Interpolate depth
 + Wherever it's less than the value in buffer:
 + Overwrite the buufer value and add the wall ID to the walls buffer
 - After calculating all the walls, iterate over depth buffer columns
 - Represent each value by vertical strip
